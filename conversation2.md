- Human: CAP02_CHALLENGE Añade un nuevo endpoint al aplicativo que permita eliminar todos los registros de db
- Assistant: Certainly! I'll add a new endpoint to delete all records from the database. Here's how we can implement this:

  1. First, let's add a new method to the `FakeDB` class in `app/db.py`:

  ```python
  class FakeDB:
      # ... existing methods ...

      def delete_all_tasks(self):
          self.tasks = []
  ```

  2. Now, let's add the new endpoint in `app/routers/tasks_router.py`:

  ```python
  from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
  from models import Task, UpdateTaskModel, TaskList
  from db import db

  tasks_router = APIRouter()

  @tasks_router.delete("/all", response_model=dict)
  async def delete_all_tasks():
      db.delete_all_tasks()
      return {"message": "All tasks have been deleted"}
  ```

  This new endpoint will:

  - Use the HTTP DELETE method.
  - Be accessible at the `/tasks/all` path.
  - Call the `delete_all_tasks()` method on our `db` instance.
  - Return a message confirming that all tasks have been deleted.

  To use this new endpoint, you would send a DELETE request to `/tasks/all`. In a production environment, you might want to add safeguards or authentication to prevent accidental data loss.

- Human: CAP02_CHALLENGE Al probar este endpont tasks/all en Postman, me devuelve esto:

  ```
  {
      "detail": [
          {
              "type": "int_parsing",
              "loc": [
                  "path",
                  "task_id"
              ],
              "msg": "Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer",
              "input": "all"
          }
      ]
  }
  "DELETE /tasks/all HTTP/1.1" 422 Unprocessable Entity
  ```

  Dime como solucionar este error.

- Assistant: The issue is due to the routing definition in `app/routers/tasks_router.py`. To fix it, make sure the route `/all` doesn’t interfere with the path that expects an integer task ID. The solution is to place the `/all` route above the route that handles `DELETE /{task_id}`. Here's the corrected version of the router:

  ```python
  @tasks_router.delete("/all", response_model=dict)
  async def delete_all_tasks():
      db.delete_all_tasks()
      return {"message": "All tasks have been deleted"}

  @tasks_router.delete("/{task_id}")
  async def delete_task(task_id: int):
      db.delete_task(task_id)
      return {"message": "Task deleted successfully"}
  ```

  By placing `/all` first, FastAPI will route it correctly without interpreting "all" as an integer task ID.
